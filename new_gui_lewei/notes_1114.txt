Notes for the new tkinter GUI design
Lewei

0. use class ways of passing all internal variables, but not the old way as before

1. have a file for all variables, every other class/main file import that file

2. have a main file for controller class, and global functions (e.g. animation)
In controller, import all frame classes and make use of them
find out ways of updating (function)

3. have a file for each frame

4. not necessary make a class for everything (e.g. a button, entry)
everytime i want to create a button, i have a create a button2 (instead of using the same class since they would be the same object)
